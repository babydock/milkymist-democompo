[> Milkymist Demo Compo
-----------------------

The demoparty MAIN#4 (http://www.mainparty.net/) will take place from October 
2 to 4 in Arles (France) with a lot of famous teams from the demoscene. The 
theme of this demoparty is the lightness of code.

The idea here is to present a compo based on the Milkymist hardware platform 
within a month. It may be a 2D/3D compo (or 2D only) and must be less than 10min 
long.

If you have ideas and/or want to be part of this, there is a small wiki page 
at http://www.tmplab.org/wiki/index.php/DemoParty_Compo_with_MilkyMist. Feel 
free to subscribe and edit this page (or the discussion tab).


Milkymist is an opensource VJing system-on-chip for FPGA boards,
compatible with MilkDrop presets.
